# Go tutorial - weather forecast

This repository is done following a Go programming tutorial and extending it. 
The basic idea is to provide a web interface that gives you the mean of the temperatures in one city, based on three different weather API's.

Run the app with __go run main.go__ and then visit the url: localost:8080/weather/<city_name> and you will get back a JSON with the weather data.
